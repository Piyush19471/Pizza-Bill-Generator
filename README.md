# üçïPizza-Bill-Generator
The Pizza Bill Generator is a project that applies core OOP principles to manage orders and calculate the total bill for pizza orders. The system provides:

Pizza Customization:
Customers can select pizza size (small, medium, large), toppings (like cheese, pepperoni, veggies), and crust type. Each option influences the final price.

Order Management:
The system keeps track of customer orders, allowing multiple pizzas with different customizations in a single order.

Bill Calculation:
The system calculates the total bill based on selected pizza options and quantities, applying any discounts or additional charges, like extra toppings.
